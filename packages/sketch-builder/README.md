# @sketchmine/sketch-builder

The sketch-builder is the centerpiece of this library. It takes control over generating .sketch files from any HTML that is provided to the library. It can draw a symbol library or a plain web page. The orchestration for drawing the whole library is done by the @sketchmine/library itself.

## Dependency graph

## The CLI

The package can be consumed in two ways. It can be executed via the CLI (command line interface). You have to install the package with Yarn or NPM from `@sketchmine/sketch-builder` and then proceed with `npx skm-sketch-builder -c ...` Therefore you have to provide at least one option:

### CLI options

| flag | description |
|---|---|
| -h, --help | displays the help page ðŸ““ |
| -c, --configÂ | path to the configuration file `./config.json` |

The `config.json` can have one of two configurations:

1. Drawing any other page
2. Drawing the Symbols Library

#### Drawing a page

The first option is to configure it to draw any webpage. A sample configuration for this is provided in the [`config.smaple-page.json`](./config.sample-page.json).

##### TL;DR Configuration options

The basic configuration for drawing a page would look like the folowing JSON structure.

1. The Page to be drawn have to be provided via the `host` property.
2. The `rootElement` tells the drawer where to start can be any DOM Node.
3. The `pages` array is capable for drawing multiple pages *(get joined with the `host` options)*
4. Last but not least the `outFile` specify a folder and a file where it should be written to.

The pages array provides the option to draw multiple pages. if only the root page should be drawn pass an empty string or a `/`.

```json
{
  "host": {
    "protocol": "https",
    "name": "barista.dynatrace.com"
  },
  "rootElement": "body",
  "pages": ["components/button"],
  "outFile": "_library/barista-dynatrace.sketch"
}

```

##### Advanced configuration

###### View port

For drawing the page a headless chromium called [puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) is used that can be configured via the `chrome` property in the config.json.

You can pass the viewport options according to the [puppeteer viewport](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/master/docs/api.md#pagesetviewportviewport) specs.

```json
{
  ...
  "chrome": {
    "defaultViewport": {
      "width": 1200,
      "height": 600,
      "deviceScaleFactor": 1,
      "isMobile": false,
      "hasTouch": false,
      "isLandscape": false
    }
  }
}
```

###### Preview image for Sketch

If you want a custom preview image for your Sketch file you can pass a path to any `.png` file with the `"previewImage": "path/to/preview.png",` property in the configuration JSON.

###### Custom dom-agent

If you have your own implementation of the **@sketchmine/dom-agent** you can provide the path to the source file that should be injected via the `"agent": "/path/to/agent.js"` property.

###### Meta infromation for symbol detection

> Currently only supported for drawing the @dynatrace library!

With the property `"metaInformation": "path/to/meta.json"` set (this includes the path to the meta information that is generated with the **@sketchmine/code-analyzer** and holds all symbols) symbol detection can be processed.

#### Drawing a symbol library

To draw a library with symbols you need to implement an API that listens to the events that are described in the [builder-api](./src/builder-api). The sample configuration for that is provided under [`config.smaple-library.json`](./config.sample-library.json).

In our environment, the property `library` points to an Angular app that is served under `http://localhost:4200`. This application is built by the **@sketchmine/app-builder**. There you can see a sample implementation of the API communication that provides the sketch builder with the information about when to draw and which user interaction should be triggered (for example, clicking an element to open a dialog that should be drawn as a Sketch symbol).

Further, `rootElement` should be changed to get the first root element of the application.

Last but not least, the type information for the configuration is located under [sketch-builder.d.ts](./src/sketch-builder.d.ts).

## How to develop

You need to adjust the `config.json` to your needs, as described in the previous section.
After a `yarn install` is performed you can go ahead and build it.

### How to build

To build the package, [Rollup.js](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en) is used as a module bundler. The configuration can be found in the `rollup.config.js` file and is orchestrated by the [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) package manager.
The package bundle is formatted as commonjs and is meant to be consumed only by Node.js applications.

The build can be started with the following two commands:

- `yarn build` for building the package.
- `yarn dev` for building and watching the sources of the package.

### Running the package

The package can be executed with node like `node lib/bin.js`. If you need to orchestrate the builder in the script you can import it and provide the config to the main function as Object.

### Debugging

For debugging, you can specify specific debug spaces with `DEBUG=${space1},${space2},${space3}... node lib/bin` or just set `DEBUG` to `true`.

If you want to speed up the sketch-builder, you can skip the headless Chrome part and use a static JSON file from the fixtures.
The fixture file is located under `/tests/fixtures/library.json`.

If you pass the Node environment `TRAVERSER=skip-traverser node ...` to the node command the fixture file is used.

#### Available debug spaces for granular logging:

* `debug` (general information about all the drawn symbols with measurements)
* `dom-traverser` (result of the DOM Traverser)

### Linting

The source code of this package will be linted by our CI environment. To ensure a coding standard and quality use the configured linter [tslint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/). This package extends from the `tslint-config-airbnb` and the linting configuration extends from the root `tslint.json`.

Run `yarn lint` to execute the linter.

### Testing the package

To ensure that the sketch-builder is working, write tests and put them in a properly named file.

**Note**: All tests based on this package should be wrapped in a `describe` method with the prefix: `[sketch-builder] â€º ...` like the following:

```typescript
// import statements

describe('[sketch-builder] â€º ${folder} â€º ${description of the suite}', () => {
  // your tests should be placed here
});
```

> The [Jest framework](https://jestjs.io/) has been selected for tests.

Run `yarn test` to execute all tests specified for the sketch-builder. Run `yarn test -f filename.test` to execute only tests that match the provided RegExp for the filename.
